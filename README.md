# Abstract</br>
The pilot contamination causing by the reuse in adjacent cells in massive MIMO for 5G is an important issue to deal with. </br>
In our paper, a novel pilot decontamination scheme based on two existing schemes (soft pilot reuse and weighted-graphed-coloring-based pilot decontamination) is proposed. All users are firstly separated into two categories: cell centered users that reuse the same pilot sequences and cell edged users that use other orthogonal pilot subgroups to get rid of the severe contamination. But the slight contamination among the cell centered users still exists. Then, in order to improve the decontamination of cell centered users, a weighted-graph-based method is applied. </br>
With such combination, the proposed scheme is able to mitigate the contamination and improve the quality of communication significantly, which is verified by simulation results. </br>
